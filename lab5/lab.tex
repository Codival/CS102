\normalpage{Specification}{%
\btext{.1}{.3}{.6}{
The API for giphy can be found for free on the mashape marketplace
}
This program will allow the user to type in a search word and then 
search the Giphy website to find a gif related to the word they searched.
Once it finds the gif it will animate it in a seperate window, which 
will scale with the gif's size.

\normalpage{Analysis}{%
\btext{.15}{.2}{.6}{%
Each url is a hyperlink which leads to a webpage where you can learn 
more about each part of the program
}
We will use the \url{market.mashape.com/explore}mashape market to get 
the API for the Giphy website from \url{market.mashape.com/giphy/giphy}.
 We will also use a json API from
 \url{https://github.com/nlohmann/json} to parse the json data and 
also the CURL API, from \url{curl.haxx.se/libcurl} to get the gif 
file. The gif will be animated using FLTK and Cairo from 
\url{www.fltk.org/doc-1.3/group__group__cairo.html}
}
\normalpage{Design}{%
\btext{.15}{.7}{.6}{%
Each of the implementation slides, and therefore each .cpp file, has 
one function in it.  The function shares the name of the file aswell.
