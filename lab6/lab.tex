\normalpage{Specification}{%
We are going to use the "Rest Countires v1" API which can be found at
\url{https://market.mashape.com/fayder/rest-countries-v1} and create 
a GUI that is a quiz game similiar to "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" 
using the data from the API, such as Country, Captial, Currency, and Population, 
to create a question, answer, and multiple fake answers. To make it more
difficult there will be no life lines, but they can get a total of three
answers wrong before they lose. Displayed by the number of X in the corner.
We will also create a seperate GUI for the Scoreboard, the score will be
given based number of correct answers.  The top 10 scores will be saved
 on a leaderboard in the program. However, game progress will not be 
saved for future play, if you close the game you must restart.

\normalpage{Analysis: Part 1}{%
\qi{INPUTS}
\qii{The user will be able to move the mouse and click their answer}
\qii{Also enter and save their name and top 10 scores}
\qi{OUTPUTS}
\qii{The user will see two windows: one for score and one for questions 
and answers}
\qii{If they click the wrong a red “X” will appear in the bottom right 
corner and they get to choose again up to 3 “X”}
\qii{If they click the right answer a green checkmark will appear in the
 bottom left and they will continue onto the next question.}

\normalpage {Analysis: Part 2}{%
\qi{PROCESS}
\qii{Make a country list of 30 countries}
\qii{Make a question list of 3 questions with blanks for the countries}
\qiii{What is the Population of (Insert Country Here)?}
\qiii{What is the Currency of (Insert Country Here)?}
\qiii{What is the Capital of (Insert Country Here)?}
\qii{The code picks a random question from the question list and a 
random country from the country list and formats them together}
\qii{The code also picks 3 fake answer choices based off the data of 
other countries}
\qii{The question and answers are displayed to the user and they choose 
one answer}
\qiii{If correct they will continue to the next question and repeat 
till they get 10 right}
\qiii{If wrong they are given a strike and three strikes equal game 
over}
\qii{When the game ends, either after 10 correct answers or game over 
they will see their leaderboard}
\qiii{If their score is in the top 10 they can save it with their 
name}
\qiii{If their score is not in the top 10 it will just display the 
leaderboard with their score}
